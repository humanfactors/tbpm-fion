# TBPM E-prime Extraction
My first released Go project. This extracts an E-prime log file and outputs to wide form CSV.

**Note that E-prime exports to UTF-16 but this program only accepts UTF8**. Therefore you will need to manually convert these (I do have a program for this as well).

To developers, this might contain some pointers as to how to extract E-prime logs using Golang. Nothing fancy - but I'm happy to accept pull requests or future collaborations to make a more general library.
